# DARK KITCHEN

## Roadmap

* Create a list of dishes that people will order online.

* The website should be responsive, it should work on a standard mobile resolution and on desktop

* You must list the food using some sort of card templates

* You should categorize your food to be able to filter it (ex: vegan, comfort food)

* You should create a shopping cart component to display the selected dishes and display the total amount of the delivery

* You should create a dark mode switch, to toggle your design between a light and a dark mode
